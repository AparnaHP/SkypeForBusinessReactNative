# Skype For Business App SDK in ReactNative

Skype for Business App SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate messaging, audio, and video experiences into mobile and tablet applications. This meeting application in react native will help you to get started with Audio/Video features in Skype for Business App SDK.

This sample contains native modules to link SFB App SDKs in android and iOS. To run you have to type yarn install and enter your meeting URL in CallScreen.Js as shown below:
NativeModules.ActivityStarter.loadSkypeForBusiness("https://meet.lync.com/putyoururlhere","David Max")

Note: These SDKs are laggy and will get deprecated soon to make Microsoft Teams dominant.
